so far, I can at least adjust the endpoint damage in FinalizeAndAddInjury,
look at the hediff_injury at what we are doing with printMyShit function
I can clearly access the weapon type, which allows me to adjust the damage at the end at least

next Ill check if I can do a similar thing in the armor calculations and shield calculations

okay armor calculations does not recieve this easy input, but luckily this we can do some fancy stuff
with a static class handler

basically if we use the float and inequality thing we only have 128 weapon variants which we can use,
due to the amount being equal to log(base2)3*10^38
which is 127 + the 0 which is 128

okay the three things we need to adjust are the
compshield func
applyarmor
and finalize add injuyr

apply armor is the only one that doesnt recieve the weapon type, but the function
immediatly above does... the solution is not entirely apparent...
we could make a whole system for storing and finding the damage types... but we need to
fundamentally alter the armor logic anyway so... I think its probably best to just replace
that function entirely... and we can than just throw the damageinfo to it to recieve what
type of weapon and such, or just whatever info we actually need

okay so the damageinfo has the armorpenetration inside it, and as we don't need to adjust this in
applyarmor iterations we can just accept this as the armor penetration
I really don't know why he doesnt give the function the damageinfo... every single other instance gets it

okay ive been trying to see if I could do a funny trick where I would just replace the defs in the 
def call so I wouldn't have to make two def files, both a replacement def for the weapon and
the extra weapon info (armordamage shielddamage), but it looks like I cant.
this really isnt an issue, but It would of been nice if I could make it work. you probably can...
but i don't know how
