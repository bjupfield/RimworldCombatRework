so far, I can at least adjust the endpoint damage in FinalizeAndAddInjury,
look at the hediff_injury at what we are doing with printMyShit function
I can clearly access the weapon type, which allows me to adjust the damage at the end at least

next Ill check if I can do a similar thing in the armor calculations and shield calculations

okay armor calculations does not recieve this easy input, but luckily this we can do some fancy stuff
with a static class handler

basically if we use the float and inequality thing we only have 128 weapon variants which we can use,
due to the amount being equal to log(base2)3*10^38
which is 127 + the 0 which is 128
