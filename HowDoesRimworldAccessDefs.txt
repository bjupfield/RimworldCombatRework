Simply with a struct...

okay heres the way we saw how it was using, which was by going down the rabbit hole of what generates weapons for new pawns,
which we found in
verse.pawn.generator.trygeneratenewpanwinternal
calls
verse.pawngenerategearfor

which uses
pawnweapongenerator.trygenerateweaponfor

and the 

class

pawnweapongeneraator

has the function

pawnweapongenerator.restet

calls
thingstuffpair.allwith

which use DefDatabase<ThingDef>.AllDefsListForReading,
to read from the defs

so basically jsut search up the thingstuffpair.allwith in the ilspy and go from there


reset is called in playdataloader.doplayload
